We will use the NBA data from 1950 to 2015 to analyze the performance of any individual or the team. The data has details like a number of teams, the number of players in each team in a different year, age, and physical measures of players, etc. We will make a machine learning model analyze the data and visualize in a simple format so that NBA committees can understand different aspects like which team performed best and how many players are there in that team plus the physical measures of that players during that event etc. so with the derived data, they can make an informed decision to improve the team performance.
