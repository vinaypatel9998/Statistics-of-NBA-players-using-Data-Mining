## Introduction

<br/>

It was not long ago, with no technical background, I started to teach myself coding in Data Science by dive into MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) courses in my spare time. Now it's about time to try it out.

This is my first attempt to do Kaggle kernel. I previously made this presentation available in [here](https://rpubs.com/ninjazzle/NBASeasons0) and [there](https://rpubs.com/ninjazzle/NBASeasons1).

Since I’ve been NBA fans since very young and being absent from following NBA regularly for a long time, this dataset is perfect for my first attempt at doing a self-directed project, as it is convenience for me to dig deeper into learning Data Science and NBA, while reaping the joy of producing it.

I expect to use this opportunity to gain more experience by challenging myself to implement my new skill while expanding it by exploring various methods of data wrangling and visualization, then communicating the findings efficiently in an aesthetic manner. In this way, I can expect to shape my skills through practical learning.

The objective is to present NBA seasons statistical facts through compelling visualization and tables. I do not make any predictive analysis here.

My intention posting here is to gain feedback to improve myself, so please leave a comment or two.

<br/>

**Few things to notice**

While the NBA, like anything from the USA, using the [imperial system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units), like the rest of the world, I prefer to use the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system). Therefore, I converted all measurement units to a metric system.

Historically, only three positions were recognized (two guards, two forwards, and one center) based on where they played on the court. During the 1980s, as team strategy evolved after the three-point field goal and the three-point arc were added to the basketball court, more specialized roles developed, resulting in the five position designations used today. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions))

In here, for simplicity and esthetical purpose, I arbitrarily framed up all the players into the standard five position used today and then color-coded them. This is essensial because I tend to make good use of this  frequently.

<br/>
<br/>


## Data Preparation Stage

<br/>

Loading necessary packages...

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(measurements)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(plotly)
library(reshape2)
library(kableExtra)
```

<br/>

Processing Data...

```{r processing}
## Create additional functions

# Mode average
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

convertHeight <- function(x) {
    x <- as.character(x)
    split <- strsplit(x, "-")
    feet <- as.numeric(split[[1]][1])
    inch <- as.numeric(split[[1]][2])
    round(conv_unit(feet, "ft", "cm") + conv_unit(inch, "inch", "cm"),0)
}

# Load the data.

NBA <- read.csv("NBA/Seasons_Stats.csv")[, c(2:9, 11:20, 32:53)]
PlayerData <- read.csv("NBA/player_data.csv")[, c(1:3, 5:6)]

# Remove NA rows
NBA <- NBA %>% filter(!is.na(Year), !is.na(Player))

# Remove Team = TOT (which indicates total, when player played in more than 1 team in a season)
NBA <- NBA[NBA$Tm != "TOT",]

# Remove of "*" which indicates a player is a member of NBA Hall of Fame
NBA$Player <- gsub("\\*$", "", NBA$Player)

# Fix player data
PlayerData[2143, 4] = as.factor("6-2")
PlayerData[2143, 5] = 190
NBA[21304, 3] = "SG"

#Renaming some columns of the dataset

colnames(PlayerData) <- c("Name", "YearStart", "YearEnd", "Height-feet", "Weight-lbs")

# Merging data

NBA <- sqldf("SELECT * FROM NBA JOIN PlayerData ON NBA.Player = PlayerData.Name 
      WHERE NBA.Year >= PlayerData.YearStart AND NBA.Year <= PlayerData.YearEnd")

# Fixing Position

# In here, for simplicity and aesthetical purpose, I arbitrarily framed up all the players into the standard five position used today and then color-coded them:

NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "C-F"] <- "C"
NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "F-C"] <- "PF"
NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "F"] <- "PF"
NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "F-G"] <- "SF"
NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "G"] <- "SG"
NBA$Pos[NBA$Pos == "G-F"] <- "SF"
NBA$Pos <- factor(NBA$Pos, levels = c("C", "PF", "SF", "SG", "PG"))
PosColorCode <- c("C"="#FF0000", "PF"="#FFA500", "SF"="#DDDD00" ,"SG"="#0000FF", "PG"="#32CD32")

# Create new variables:

NBA <- NBA %>%
    rowwise() %>%
    mutate(Height = convertHeight(`Height-feet`),
           Weight = round(conv_unit(`Weight-lbs`, "lbs", "kg"),0),
           BMI = round(Weight / (Height / 100)^2, 2),
           Born = Year - Age,
           ORpG = ORB / G,
           DRpG = DRB / G,
           RpG = TRB / G,
           ApG = AST / G,
           SpG = STL / G,
           BpG = BLK / G,
           TpG = TOV / G,
           PpG = PTS / G,
           Position = cell_spec(Pos,
                            color = "white",
                            align = "c",
                            background = factor(Pos, c("C", "PF", "SF", "SG", "PG"),
                                                PosColorCode)))

# Arrange the table.

NBA <- NBA %>%
    select(Year:MP, YearStart:BMI, "Born", FG:PTS, TS.:TOV., ORpG:PpG, "Position", -c("Height-feet", "Weight-lbs"))

# Create duplicate table with normalized stats.

NBA_Scaled <- NBA %>% mutate_at(vars(c(G:MP, FG:PpG)), scale)

NBA_Scaled <- NBA
NBA_Scaled[, c(6:8, 15:54)] <- scale(NBA[, c(6:8, 15:54)])
```

<br/>

<br/>

## Analyzing Stage

In this session, we start by exploring the players. The variables that will be enticing to explore include their positions, height, weight, born and age.

<br/>

### NBA Teams growth

<div class='Box'>

<br/>

We start by exploring how NBA teams and the number of players has grown over the years. The table will show the detailed numbers.

```{r teamplayer, warning=FALSE}
Team_Player <- NBA %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(nPlayers = n_distinct(Player),
            nTeams = n_distinct(Tm),
            nGames = max(G),
            Players_per_Team = round(nPlayers/nTeams, 2)) 

Team_Player %>%
    kable(escape = FALSE, align='c', caption = "Players, Teams and Games") %>%
    kable_styling("striped", full_width = T) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
```

<br/>

Now we see how NBA teams have grown, with this simple plot.

```{r TeamGrowth, fig.width = 9, fig.height=5}
Team_Player %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(Year, nTeams, linetype = "Trend line")) +
    ggtitle("Number of NBA Teams by Year") +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(Team_Player$nTeams), linetype = "Average line"),
               col = "red",
               alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2017, 10)) +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c(2, 1), guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
    ylab("Number of Teams") +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

<li>The number of NBA teams has grown from 17 in 1950 to 30 in 2017.</li>
<li>Lowest number of teams occur during 1956-1961 seasons, with only 8 teams competes.</li>
<li>The highest number of teams occur from 2005 until present with 30 teams.</li>
    
</ul>

</div>

<br/>

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

### Number of NBA Players

<div class='Box'>

<br/>

We can plot number of NBA players year by year based on the same table.

```{r PlayerGrowth, fig.width = 9, fig.height=5}
Team_Player %>%
    ggplot(aes(Year, nPlayers, fill=nPlayers)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    ggtitle("Number of NBA Players by Year") +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(Team_Player$nPlayers), linetype = "Average line"),
               col = "red",
               alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2017, 10)) +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = 2) +
    ylab("Number of Players") +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

<li>The number of NBA players has grown `r round((Team_Player$nPlayers[nrow(Team_Player)]-Team_Player$nPlayers[1]) / Team_Player$nPlayers[1] * 100, 2)` %, from `r Team_Player$nPlayers[1]` in 1950 to `r Team_Player$nPlayers[nrow(Team_Player)]` in 2017.</li>
<li>The average number of players compete in NBA regular season is `r round(mean(Team_Player$nPlayers), 2)`</li>
<li>The least number of players competes in a season is `r min(Team_Player$nPlayers)` players during 1955-1956 & 1958-1959 season.</li>
<li>The most number of players competes in a season is `r max(Team_Player$nPlayers)` players in 2014-2015 season.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

### Height Distribution

<div class="Box">

<br/>

We all know basketball players are tall, naturally, I want to know how tall most of them are, and how small we are (average height person) compared to their standard.

```{r HeightDist, fig.width = 9, fig.height=5}
HeightMean <- mean(NBA$Height)
HeightSD <- sd(NBA$Height)

NBA %>% ggplot(aes(Height, fill=TRUE)) +
    geom_density() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(160, 240, 10)) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = HeightMean, linetype = "Average height of NBA players"),
               col = "red",
               alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 177, linetype = "Average height of American male"),
               col = "blue",
               alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(seq(HeightMean, 240, HeightSD), seq(HeightMean, 160, -HeightSD)),
               col = "blue",
               alpha = 0.3,
               linetype = 5) +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c(1, 1)) +
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

<li>Average height of NBA players is: `r round(mean(NBA$Height, na.rm=T), 1)` cm, with standard deviation: `r round(sd(NBA$Height, na.rm=T), 1)`.</li>
<li>Average height of American men is 177 cm ([source](https://halls.md/average-height-men-height-weight/)) is shorter by more than two standard deviation away from average NBA players.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

Now let's see the groundcrawlers and the skyscrapers in the NBA.

```{r shortest, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Height, Player) %>%
    summarise(Pos = getmode(Position),
              YearActive = paste(mean(YearStart), "-", mean(YearEnd)),
              Team = getmode(Tm),
              Games = sum(G),
              PPG = round(sum(PTS)/sum(G), 2)) %>%
    arrange(Height) %>%
    head() %>%
    kable(escape=F, align="c", caption = "Shortest Players") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777")

NBA %>%
    group_by(Height, Player) %>%
    summarise(Pos = getmode(Position),
              YearActive = paste(mean(YearStart), "-", mean(YearEnd)),
              Team = getmode(Tm),
              Games = sum(G),
              PPG = round(sum(PTS)/sum(G), 2)) %>%
    arrange(desc(Height)) %>%
    head(n=8) %>%
    kable(escape=F, align="c", caption = "Tallest Players") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777")
```

<br/>

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

### Height Comparison

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Next, I'd like to compare them side-by-side, from Center to Point Guard, and find their averages and ranges.

```{r heightpos, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Pos) %>%
    summarise(MinHeight = min(Height),
              MaxHeight = max(Height),
              MedianHeight = median(Height),
              ModeHeight = getmode(Height),
              MeanHeight = round(mean(`Height`), 2)) %>%
    mutate(Pos = cell_spec(Pos,
                            color = "white",
                            align = "c",
                            background = factor(Pos, c("C", "PF", "SF", "SG", "PG"),
                                                PosColorCode))) %>%
    kable("html", escape=F, align="c", caption = "Height: Averages and Range by Position") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "center")
```

Violin plot not only gives us the averages and ranges, but it also gives us the distribution.

```{r HeightComparison, fig.width = 9, fig.height=5}
NBA %>%
  ggplot(aes(Pos, Height, color=Pos)) +
  geom_violin() +
  ggtitle("Height distribution by position") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=8, size=6) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(NBA$Height, na.rm=T), linetype = "Average NBA players"),
             col = "red",
             alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 177, linetype = "Average American male"),
             col = "blue",
             alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual("Pos", values = PosColorCode) +
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c(1, 1)) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

### BMI Distribution

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Next, let's explore the BMI (Body Mass Index) of the players.

```{r BMIDist, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
BMI <- NBA %>%
    group_by(Player) %>%
    filter(!is.na(BMI)) %>%
    mutate(BMIGroup = ifelse(BMI < 18.5, "Underweight",
                               ifelse(BMI >= 18.5 & BMI < 25, "Healthy weight",
                                      ifelse(BMI >= 25 & BMI < 30, "Overweight",
                                             "Obese Class I")))) %>%
    summarise(Pos = getmode(Position),
              Height = getmode(Height),
              Weight = getmode(Weight),
              BMI = getmode(BMI),
              BMIGroup = getmode(BMIGroup),
              Games = sum(G),
              PPG = round(sum(PTS)/Games, 1))

shade <- data.frame(xstart = c(15, 25, 30), xend = c(18.5, 30, 33), col = c("#F00", "#0F0", "#00F"))
BMIclass <- data.frame(X = c(15.7, 20, 26.5, 31), Y = 0.27, label = c("Underweight", "Healthy weight", "Overweight", "Obese"))
BMIMean <- mean(BMI$BMI)
BMISD <- sd(BMI$BMI)

BMI %>% ggplot() +
    geom_rect(data = shade,
              aes(xmin = xstart, xmax = xend, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf, fill = col),
              alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_density(aes(BMI, fill=TRUE)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 33, 1)) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = BMIMean, linetype = "Average line"),
               col = "black",
               alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(seq(BMIMean, 33, BMISD), seq(BMIMean, 15, -BMISD)),
               col = "blue",
               alpha = 0.3,
               linetype = 5) +
    geom_text(data = BMIclass,
              mapping = aes(x = X, y = Y, label = label),
              size = 3,
              vjust = 0,
              hjust = 0,
              color = "forestgreen") +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c(1, 1, 1, 1)) +
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">
BMI category based on [WHO standard BMI classification.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#Categories)

<li>Average BMI: `r round(mean(BMI$BMI), 1)`, with standard deviation: `r round(sd(BMI$BMI),1)`</li>
<li>As expected, most players, `r round(mean(BMI$BMIGroup == "Healthy weight")*100, 1)`% are in the "Healthy Weight" category.</li>
<li>`r round(mean(BMI$BMIGroup == "Overweight")*100, 1)`% players are in "Overweight" category, which is still common in athletes.</li>
<li>`r nrow(BMI[BMI$BMIGroup == "Obese Class I",])` players(`r round(mean(BMI$BMIGroup == "Obese Class I")*100, 1)`%) are in "Obese Class I" category, Shaquille O'Neal is one of them.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

Now I'm interested to see the real BIG guys in the NBA.

```{r obese, warning=FALSE}

### Chronological Size Growth

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Inspired by Hans Rosling's animated bubble chart from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles), I challenged myself to see if I can make one myself with this dataset. Weight in the x-axis, height in the y-axis, size for BMI, and color represent their position in the field. Don't forget to click **"Play"** to see them grows year-by-year.

```{r HeightBubble, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8,plotly=TRUE}
pBubble <- NBA %>%
    filter(!is.na(BMI), !is.na(Weight), !is.na(Height)) %>%
    plot_ly(x = ~Weight,
            y = ~Height,
            size = ~BMI,
            color = ~Pos,
            colors = PosColorCode,
            frame = ~Year,
            text = ~Player, 
            hoverinfo = "text",
            type = 'scatter',
            mode = 'markers') %>% 
    animation_opts(1000, easing = "elastic",
                   redraw = FALSE) %>% 
    animation_button(x = 1,
                     xanchor = "right",
                     y = 0,
                     yanchor = "bottom") %>%
    animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "Year: ", font = list(color="red")))

### Ability by Position Comparison

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Since we now know that height is strongly correlated with their position in the field, naturally I'm interested to see how their abilities differ based on their roles.

To compare multiple variables with different scales, I use normalized (scaled) data I created previously. This makes "0" in the scale is the average of each variable, anything below "0" tells us that the group performance in that particular category is below average, and vice versa.

```{r RadarPos, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, plotly=TRUE}
RadarHeight <- NBA_Scaled %>%
    group_by(Pos) %>%
    summarise(Shoot2P = mean(X2P., na.rm=T),
              Shoot3P = mean(X3P., na.rm=T),
              ShootFT = mean(FT., na.rm=T),
              OffensiveRB = mean(ORB, na.rm=T),
              Assist = mean(AST, na.rm=T),
              DefensiveRB = mean(DRB, na.rm=T),
              Steal = mean(STL, na.rm=T),
              Block = mean(BLK, na.rm=T)) %>%
    select(-Pos)

pRadar <- plot_ly(type = 'scatterpolar',
        fill = 'toself',
        mode = 'lines') %>%
    add_trace(r = as.numeric(as.vector(RadarHeight[1,])),
              theta = as.character(as.vector(colnames(RadarHeight))),
              name = 'C',
              fillcolor = "#FF0000",
              opacity = 0.5) %>%
    add_trace(r = as.numeric(as.vector(RadarHeight[2,])),
              theta = as.character(as.vector(colnames(RadarHeight))),
              name = 'PF',
              fillcolor = "#FFA500",
              opacity = 0.5) %>%
    add_trace(r = as.numeric(as.vector(RadarHeight[3,])),
              theta = as.character(as.vector(colnames(RadarHeight))),
              name = 'SF',
              fillcolor = "#DDDD00",
              opacity = 0.5) %>%
    add_trace(r = as.numeric(as.vector(RadarHeight[4,])),
              theta = as.character(as.vector(colnames(RadarHeight))),
              name = 'SG',
              fillcolor = "#0000FF",
              opacity = 0.5) %>%
    add_trace(r = as.numeric(as.vector(RadarHeight[5,])),
              theta = as.character(as.vector(colnames(RadarHeight))),
              name = 'PG',
              fillcolor = "#32CD32",
              opacity = 0.5) %>%
    layout(polar = list(
        radialaxis = list(
        visible = T,
        range = c(-1, 1))))
```

**How to interpret the plot:**

Click on the 'position legend' in the upper right of the graph to select/unselect each position, double-click to isolate the trace. You can compare them in any way as you desire.

So, as we can see, the graph does not just confirm the well-known fact that the tall guys (Centers) are the best shot-blockers and the short guys (Point Guards) are the best at passing the ball, we can also measure how far better they perform these task.

### Annual Age Range

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Same like with height, it would be compelling to see the age range in the NBA year-by-year.

```{r AgeYears, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Year) %>%
    summarise(Average = round(mean(Age, na.rm = T), 2),
              Max = max(Age, na.rm = T),
              Min = min(Age, na.rm = T)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Year)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Max, linetype = "Oldest"), color = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_line(aes(y = Average, linetype = "Average"), color = "black") +
    geom_line(aes(y = Min, linetype = "Youngest"), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Age Range by Year") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2017, 10)) +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c(1, 1, 1)) +
    guides(group=FALSE) +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

### Player Distribution by Generation

<div class="Box">

<br/>

NBA has been around since 1950, this suggests that many generations have passed since the first NBA season. Would it be nice to see which generation dominated the league each year?

```{r Generation, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Year, Player) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Born)) %>%
    mutate(Generation = ifelse(Born <= 1921, "The Depression Era",
                          ifelse(Born %in% 1922:1927, "World War II",
                            ifelse(Born %in% 1928:1945, "Post-War Cohort",
                              ifelse(Born %in% 1946:1954, "Baby Boomers",
                                ifelse(Born %in% 1955:1965, "Generation Jones",
                                  ifelse(Born %in% 1966:1976, "Generation X",
                                    ifelse(Born %in% 1977:1995, "Millennials",
                                      "Generation Z")))))))) %>%
    summarise(Generation = getmode(Generation)) %>%
    arrange(Year, Player) %>%
    mutate(Generation = factor(Generation, levels = c("The Depression Era",
                                                     "World War II",
                                                     "Post-War Cohort",
                                                     "Baby Boomers",
                                                     "Generation Jones",
                                                     "Generation X",
                                                     "Millennials",
                                                     "Generation Z"))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Year, y=..count.., colour=Generation, fill=Generation)) +
    geom_density(alpha=0.55) +
    ggtitle("Generation Count by Year") +
    ylab("Count") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2017, 10)) +
    theme(legend.position='bottom')
```

</div>

And here's the oldest generation of the NBA...

```{r earliest, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Player, Born) %>%
    summarise(Pos = getmode(Position),
              ActiveYears = paste(getmode(YearStart), "-", getmode(YearEnd)),
              NBASeasons = n_distinct(Year),
              Games = sum(G),
              StartingAge = min(Age),
              FinalAge = max(Age),
              PPG = round(sum(PTS)/sum(G), 1)) %>%
    arrange(Born) %>%
    select(Born, everything()) %>%
    head(9) %>%
    kable("html", escape=F, align="c", caption = "Earliest Born") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T)
```

Notice that in the `ActiveYears` column some players started their career before 1950 and the number of seasons in the `NBASeasons` column summed up after 1949. This because the NBA formally formed in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations, the *National Basketball League* (founded 1937) and the *Basketball Association of America* (founded 1946). You can dig more into NBA history [here](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Basketball-Association).

<br/>
<br/>

### Career Length in the NBA

<div class='Box'>

<br/>

My next question is how long do NBA careers last?

This can be answered by summing up the number of seasons each player participated in.

```{r Career, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
SeasonNBA <- NBA %>%
    group_by(Player, Born) %>%
    summarise(NBASeasons = n_distinct(Year))

SeasonNBA %>%
    ggplot(aes(NBASeasons)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = ..count..)) +
    ggtitle("Player Distribution by Number of Seasons") +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(NBASeasons, na.rm = T), linetype = "Average line"),
               col = "black",
               alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = 2) +
    xlab("Number of NBA Seasons") +
    ylab("Count") +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

<li>`r nrow(SeasonNBA[SeasonNBA$NBASeasons <= 1,])` players, or more than a quarter (`r round((nrow(SeasonNBA[SeasonNBA$NBASeasons <= 1,])/nrow(SeasonNBA))*100, 1)`%) of all players in the NBA history didn't survive after their first season.</li>
<li>Average career length in the NBA is `r round(mean(SeasonNBA$NBASeasons, na.rm=T),1)` years.</li>
<li>Less than half of all NBA players (`r round((nrow(SeasonNBA[SeasonNBA$NBASeasons >= 5,])/nrow(SeasonNBA))*100, 1)`%) participate in at 5 seasons or more.</li>
<li>And only 1 out of 5 players (`r round((nrow(SeasonNBA[SeasonNBA$NBASeasons >= 10,])/nrow(SeasonNBA))*100, 1)`%), can survive for 10 seasons or more.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

Now let's find out who has been in the NBA the longest...

```{r longest, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    group_by(Player, Born) %>%
    summarise(Pos = getmode(Position),
              Team = getmode(Tm),
              ActiveYears = paste(min(Year), "-", max(Year)),
              RookieAge = min(Age),
              RetirementAge = max(Age),
              Seasons = n_distinct(Year),
              RpG = round(sum(TRB)/sum(G), 1),
              PpG = round(sum(PTS)/sum(G), 1)) %>%
    arrange(desc(Seasons), ActiveYears) %>%
    select(Seasons, everything(), -Born) %>%
    head(17) %>%
    kable("html", escape=F, align="c", caption = "Longest Career in the NBA") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T)
```

The table above listed the players who have a career in the NBA for 19 years or more.

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

Few things I noticed in this group are:

<li>Most of them are well-known great players, `r round(16/17 * 100, 1)` % of them have double digits overall points per game, which only about 1 in 5 NBA players can accomplish this feat.</li>
<li>What interesting is the Centers are Power Forwards (translated: tall guys) dominated the group with `r round(6/17 * 100, 1)` % each, which makes up `r round(12/17 * 100, 1)` % in total.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

### The Rookies vs the Retirees

<div class='Box'>

<br/>

Now we take a closer look at the age when they started and finished their career in the NBA.

```{r RookieRetiree, fig.height=5, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
RRAge <- NBA %>%
    group_by(Player) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    summarise(RookieAge = min(Age),
              RetirementAge = max(Age)) %>%
    gather(Parameter, Value, RookieAge:RetirementAge)

RRAge %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(Value),fill=Parameter)) + 
    geom_bar(data=filter(RRAge, Parameter == "RetirementAge")) + 
    geom_bar(data=filter(RRAge, Parameter == "RookieAge"), aes(y = ..count.. * (-1))) +
    ggtitle("Rookie Age vs, Retirement Age in the NBA") +
    xlab("Age") +
    ylab("Count") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-1500,1500,500),labels=abs(seq(-1500,1500,500))) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
    coord_flip() +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")

RRAge <- RRAge %>%
    spread(Parameter, Value)
```

<br/>

<div class="Fact">

<ul class="CustomList">

<li>Most of the players (`r round((nrow(RRAge[RRAge$RookieAge > 21 & RRAge$RookieAge < 25,])/nrow(RRAge))*100, 1)`%) start their career in NBA between age 22-24.</li>
<li>`r round((nrow(RRAge[RRAge$RookieAge < 20,])/nrow(RRAge))*100, 1)`% of NBA players starting their career before their 20 years old birthday.</li>
<li>Only `r nrow(RRAge[RRAge$RookieAge >= 30,])` players (`r round((nrow(RRAge[RRAge$RookieAge >= 30,])/nrow(RRAge))*100, 1)`%) starting their career in their 30's.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<br/>

```{r olderstrookies, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    filter(YearStart >= 1950) %>%
    group_by(Player) %>%
    summarise(RookieAge = min(Age),
              Pos = getmode(Position),
              Team = getmode(Tm),
              RetirementAge = max(Age),
              NBAYears = paste(min(Year), "-", max(Year)),
              NBASeasons = n_distinct(Year),
              Games = sum(G),
              PpG = round(sum(PTS)/Games,2)) %>%
    arrange(desc(RookieAge)) %>%
    select(RookieAge, everything()) %>%
    head(10) %>%
    kable("html", escape=F, align="c", caption = "Oldest NBA Rookies") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777")
```

Bear in mind that these are rookies as in the NBA. Some of them might already have years of experience in another professional basketball league.

```{r oldestplayer, warning=FALSE}
NBA %>%
    select(Age, Player, Position, Year, Tm, G, GS, PTS) %>%
    mutate(PPG = round(PTS/G, 2)) %>%
    arrange(desc(Age)) %>%
    head(n=10) %>%
    kable("html", escape=F, align="c", caption = "Oldest NBA Players") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(2, bold = T) %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#777777")
```

<br/>

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

### Age vs Chance and Ability

<div class="Box">

<br/>

Lastly, I'd like to know how age correlates with their chances and ability in the field.

```{r AgeCor, fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
AgeCor <- NBA_Scaled %>%
    group_by(Age) %>%
    summarise(Games = mean(G, na.rm = T),
              GameStarted = mean(GS, na.rm = T),
              MinutesPlayed = mean(MP, na.rm = T),
              Shooting = mean(TS., na.rm = T),
              ShootAttemps = mean(FGA, na.rm = T),
              Rebound = mean(RpG, na.rm = T),
              Assist = mean(ApG, na.rm = T),
              Steal = mean(SpG, na.rm = T),
              Block = mean(BpG, na.rm = T),
              Turnover = mean(TpG, na.rm = T),
              Points = mean(PpG, na.rm = T)) %>%
    gather(variable, value, -Age) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = c("Games", "GameStarted", "MinutesPlayed", "Shooting", "ShootAttemps", "Rebound", "Assist", "Steal", "Block", "Turnover", "Points")))

AgeCor %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, variable, fill=value)) +
    geom_tile(color = "grey50") +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "Reds")) +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(AgeCor$variable))) +
    ggtitle("Age, Chance and Ability") +
    ylab("Parameter") +
    theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

<br/>

It turns out that their peak around 25-30 years old, with some exception in shooting (TS%) and blocks. That is because, as we have seen in the previous table, only a handful of players still active after their 40 and 90% of them are post players who are shot-blockers with a good FG%.
